Modeling is the distillation of complex phenomena into fundamental and quantifiable elements so that we can make predictions.

Modeling is the process of capturing the most important aspects of a real-world problem with an idealized mathematical model.

Modeling is the best attempt to explain a complex real-world phenomena through mathematical process.  

Modeling is using mathematical to match the past and predict the future.

Modeling is a process used to describe phenomena and relationships for the purpose of understanding relationships and solving problems.  Modeling is not exclusive to humans. 

The process of describing phenomena using a mathematical, statistical and or graphical representation for a purpose.

Modeling is the process of creating a meaningful mathematical construct to describe and understand real-world phenomena

Modeling is the application of mathematical to real-world problems, situations, and scenarios.
