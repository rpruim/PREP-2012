  Modeling is the distillation of  complex phenomena into   fundamental   and   quantifiable   pieces that allow us to make predictions.

  Modeling is the best attempt to explain a process.

  Representing or characterizing reality for some predictive purpose.

  Modeling is physical phenomena (including chemistry, biology, etc.) expressed and analyzed through mathematical.

  Using mathematical to combine what we have observed with what we are interested in finding out to give us information about how the world works.

  Collecting, interpreting, and presenting data in a visual, concrete form using patterns (equations) that repeat in many instances.

  Applying mathematical to solve an interesting or practical problem.

  Identifying (or guessing) key factors in a real-world situation and coming up with a systematic way to make predictions based on those.

  Using mathematical to describe phenomena (a situation) and to make predictions.

  Using real-life problems to teach,  demonstrate, and  conceptualize topics and ideas in calculus and mathematical.  Bringing the real-world into the classroom. 

  Modeling is the process of finding a good mathematical explanation or representation for observed phenomena.

  Modeling is the process of constructing, testing, and applying mathematical descriptions to physical and conceptual systems, with the intent of description and/or prediction.

  All models are wrong, but some are useful.  How do we teach students to think in terms of models?

  Modeling is using mathematical to match the past and predict the future.

  Modeling is a mathematical framework for predicting outcomes of real-world problems.

  Modeling is using mathematical theory to interpret phenomena of science and engineering.

  Modeling is converting a real-world problem into a mathematical problem.

  Modeling is the process of creating a mathematical construct to solve a real-world problem.
  Modeling is representing real-world in a simple enough way to learn something useful.
