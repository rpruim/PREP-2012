The Michaelis-Menten Model
==========================

The Model
---------
In biochemistry, Michaelisâ€“Menten kinetics is one of the simplest and
best-known models of enzyme kinetics. It is named after German biochemist
Leonor Michaelis and Canadian physician Maud Menten. 
The model can be illustrated as
$$latex
\ce{
E + S <=>C[k_f][k_r] ES ->C[k_{cat}] E + P
}
$$
Where $latex E$ is the enzime, $latex S$ is the substrate, $latex ES$ is the enzyme binding to
the substrate, and $latex P$ is a product.  This says that when there is (free) enzyme and substrate around,
there is a chance that they could become bound together.  The resulting $latex ES$ complex can either dissassociate
into enzyme and substrate again, or it can be converted into enzyme and a product.


To model this situation, we to make some assumptions about how things move back and forth 
between the left and middle and also from the middle to the right.  (Notice that there
is no movement back from the right to the middle.)  First the easy bits.

 * We assume that at any moment each $latex ES$ complex has some probability of 
being converted into $latex E + S$, some probability of being converted into $latex E + P$,
and otherwise remains $latex ES$.  This is indicated by the rate constants $latex k_r$ and $latex k_{cat}$.

The tricier bit is to figure out how quickly $latex E + S$ is converted into $latex ES$.  The model for this
is based on the idea that $latex E$ and $latex S$ molecules are moving around and that each time an $latex E$ encounters
an $latex S$, there is some probability that they form $latex ES$.  So the rate is proportional to the number
potential encounters, i.e., $latex [E]\cdot [S]$.


This leads to the following system of differential equations:

$$latex 
\begin{align}
	\frac{d[S]}{dt} & = -k_f [E] [S] + k_r [ES] ]
	\label{dSdt}
	\\
	\frac{d[E]}{dt} & = -k_f [E] [S] + k_r [ES] + k_{cat} [ES]
	\label{dEdt}
	\\
	\frac{d[ES]}{dt} & = \phantom{-}k_f [E] [S] - k_r [ES] - k_{cat} [ES]
	\label{dESdt}
	\\
	\frac{d[P]}{dt} & = \phantom{-k_f [E] [S] + k_r [ES] + \;} k_{cat} [ES]
	\label{dPdt}
	\\
\end{align}
$$

Simplifying the Model
---------------------
Now we make some simplifications:

 * If the enzyme is conserved, then $[E] + [ES] = [E]_0$ is a constant.
 * In situations where $\frac{d[P]}{dt}$ is constant 
(\ref{dESdt}) and (\ref{dPdt}) imply that $\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$.
This is often used as an approximation when $\frac{d[P]}{dt}$ 
is nearly constant.
 * From this it follows that 
	$$latex
  \begin{align*}
	k_f [E] [S] & = ( k_r + k_{cat} ) [ES] 
	\\
	k_f ([E]_0 - [ES]) [S] & = ( k_r + k_{cat} ) [ES] 
	\\
	([E]_0 - [ES]) [S] & =  \frac{k_r + k_{cat}}{k_f}  [ES] 
	\\
	[E]_0 [S] & = \left( \frac{k_r + k_{cat}}{k_f} + [S] \right)  [ES] 
	\\
	[ES] & = \frac{ [E]_0 [S] }{ \frac{k_r + k_{cat}}{k_f} + [S] }  
	\\
	k_{cat} [ES] & = \frac{k_{cat} [E]_0 [S]}{ \frac{k_r + k_{cat}}{k_f} + [S]}  
	\\
	v = \frac{d[P]}{dt}& = \frac{k_{cat} [E]_0 [S]}{\frac{k_r + k_{cat}}{k_f} + [S]}
  $$
	
 * Ignoring the meaning of the constants (for the moment) 
	and focusing on the form, we now have 
	the following sort of relationship between $v$ and $[S]$
  
$$latex
	\begin{align}
	v = \frac{ \alpha [S] }{ \beta + [S] }
	\label{eq:MichMent}
\end{align}
$$
    That is, the ``velocity'' of the reaction (rate at which the product is produced)
	is determined by the concentration of the substrate and constants that do 
	not depend on $latex v$ or $latex [S]$.

Equation (\ref{eq:MichMent}) is not in our favorite linear form, but we can
use transforamtions to get into a linear form:
$$latex 
\frac{1}v
= \frac {\beta + [S] }{ \alpha [S] } 
= \frac{1}{\alpha} + \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \frac{1}{[S]} 
$$
