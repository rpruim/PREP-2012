Here's a classic related rates problem:

*A ladder 10 ft long rests against a vertical wall.  If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 ft/s, how fast is the top of te ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the wall?*

### Algebraic Solution

The standard solution is about algebra. 
1. Express the relationship between the horizontal $x$ and vertical $y$ positions: $x^2 + y^2 = 10^2$.  
2. Differentiate the expression with respect to time:
$2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.  This is perhaps a bit confusing, because there are **four** functions involved: $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, as well as $x^2 + y^2$ and $10$.
3. Solve with respect to the desired rate: $\frac{dy}{dt} = - \frac{x}{y}\frac{dx}{dt}$.
4. Plug in the values for $x$ (which is known from the problem statement) and $y$ (which needs to be figured out from the relationship between $x$ and $y$) and find $\frac{dy}{dt}$

### Graphing the relationship

Once students know how to deal with functions of two variables, a different approach is feasible.
1. Write down the **state** of the system: $x$ and $y$.
2. Write down the constraint function.  Or, in otherwords, write down the relationship between $x$ and $y$ and the length of the ladder: $x^2 + y^2 = h^2$.
3. Plot out the constraint function as a function of the state:
```{r label="constraint"}
g = makeFun( x^2 + y^2 - h^2 ~ x+y )
plotFun( g(x,y,h=10 ) ~ x+y, x.lim=c(0,10), y.lim=c(0,10))
```
4. The constraint is satisfied when the constraint function
